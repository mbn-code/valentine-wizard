# Valentine Wizard ❤️ (SaaS Edition)

Turn your love story into a digital experience.

## The SaaS Model
This version of the Valentine Wizard includes a tiered structure:

### 🆓 Free Plan ($0)
- **Interactive Invitation:** The tapping heart game.
- **Basic Dashboard:** Essential timer and 1 Spotify track (Feb 14).
- **Secret Notes:** Limited to 3 custom notes.
- **"Powered by" Watermark:** Included in the footer.

### 💎 Pro Plan ($9.99 One-time)
- **Full Customization:** Choose Spotify tracks for every stage (Feb 12, 13, 14).
- **Secret Cinema:** Upload your own personal memory video.
- **Unlimited Notes:** Write as many secret messages as you want.
- **Personal Gallery:** Integrate your own photo URLs.
- **Custom Passcode:** Set your own 4-digit code.
- **No Watermark:** Clean, premium experience.

## How it works
1. **Wizard:** Use the `/wizard` interface to select a plan and personalize the content.
2. **URL-based Storage:** All configurations are compressed and stored directly in the URL hash.
3. **No Database:** Privacy-focused and cost-effective. No user data is stored on a server.

## Deployment
Deploy to Vercel/Netlify as a static site. The URL-based configuration makes it horizontally scalable and zero-maintenance.
